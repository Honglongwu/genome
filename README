# Genome

Genome analysis software from The Genome Institute at Washington University
School of Medicine, funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute.

## Testing

Running tests currently depends on many internal resources so cannot be done so
externally.  Within The Genome Institute you can run tests by doing,

    genome-test-env test-tracker prove --lsf --git

This chains the `genome-test-env` and `test-tracker` commands together.  See
`test-tracker prove --help` for its usage.  For example, you may need to pass a
value to the `--git` option if your branch is not setup to track
`origin/master`.
