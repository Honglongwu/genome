**USAGE**

 gmt music bmr calc-wig-covg --roi-file=? --reference-sequence=? --wig-list=? --output-dir=?


**SYNOPSIS**

General usage:

 ... music bmr calc-wig-covg \
    --wig-list input_dir/wig_list \
    --output-dir output_dir/ \
    --reference-sequence input_dir/all_sequences.fa \
    --roi-file input_dir/all_coding_exons.tsv


**REQUIRED ARGUMENTS**

  roi-file
    Tab-delimited list of ROIs [chr start stop gene_name] (See Description) 
  reference-sequence
    Path to reference sequence in FASTA format 
  wig-list
    Tab-delimited list of WIG files [sample_name wig_file] (See Description) 
  output-dir
    Directory where output files and subdirectories will be written 


**DESCRIPTION**

    This script counts bases with sufficient coverage in the ROIs of each gene from given wiggle
    track format files, and categorizes them into - AT, CG (non-CpG), and CpG counts. It also adds
    up these base-counts across all ROIs of each gene for each sample, but covered bases that lie
    within overlapping ROIs are not counted more than once towards these total counts.



**ARGUMENTS**


    --roi-file

      The regions of interest (ROIs) of each gene are typically regions targeted for sequencing or
      are merged exon loci (from multiple transcripts) of genes with 2-bp flanks (splice
      junctions). For per-gene base counts, an overlapping base will be counted each time it
      appears in an ROI of the same gene. To avoid this, be sure to merge together overlapping ROIs
      of the same gene. BEDtools' mergeBed can help if used per gene.

    --reference-sequence

      The reference sequence in FASTA format. If a reference sequence index is not found next to
      this file (a .fai file), it will be created.

    --wig-list

      Provide a file containing sample names and the wiggle track format file locations for each.
      Use the tab-delimited format [sample_name wig_file] per line. Additional columns like
      clinical data are allowed, but ignored. The sample_name must be the same as the tumor sample
      names used in the MAF file (16th column, with the header Tumor_Sample_Barcode).

    --output-dir

      Specify an output directory where the following will be created/written: roi_covgs:
      Subdirectory containing per-ROI covered base counts for each sample. gene_covgs: Subdirectory
      containing per-gene covered base counts for each sample. total_covgs: File containing the
      overall non-overlapping coverages per sample.
