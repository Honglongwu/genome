    A name for the model 
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Automatically assign instrument data using the cron 
    Default value 'true' if not specified
  [1mnoauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Make auto-assign-inst-data 'false' 
  [1mforce[0m
    force model creation to occur, even if samples don't match 
    Default value 'false' (--noforce) if not specified
  [1mnoforce[0m
    Make force 'false' 
  [1mtumor-sample[0m

  [1mnormal-sample[0m
    If there are no variants, specify the "normal" sample directly 
  [1msample-list-file[0m
    A file of samples for which to make models.  Each line should have the samples that should be
    paired together with the control to the left.  If more than two are on each line, each sample
    on the line will be paired with every sample to its right in turn. (Provide this in lieu of
    variants or the --tumor-sample and --normal-sample.) 
  [1mregion-of-interest-set[0m

  [1mgroups[0m
    Group(s) to which to add the newly created model(s) 
  [1mDESIGN[0m
    BED file (or database id) of the designs for the probes 
  [1mTARGET[0m
    BED file (or database id) of the target region set 
  [1mVARIANTS[0m
    One or more BED files (or database ids) of the variants to validate 

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    To set up the model to run the validation process, three pieces of information are needed: the
    design (as sent to the vendor), the target set (as received from the vendor), and the variants
    to be validated. Each of these constituent parts are tracked individually by the analysis
    system, and this model takes the individual pieces and links them together.

    First, the individual pieces need to be added to the system. For the designs we send to the
    vendor and targets we get back from the vendor, the files are stored as feature lists. For the
    lists of variants, we track them as detect variants results, either directly from the Somatic
    Variation pipeline or from manual curation. Then the parts are assembled with this command. The
    two main commands to add the individual pieces are:

    `genome feature-list create` to create the feature lists, once for the design, and once for the
    target set.

    `genome model somatic-validation manual-result` to record the manually curated results, if
    necessary. (One per file of variants.)
