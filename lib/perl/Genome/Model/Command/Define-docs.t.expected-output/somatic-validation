[4mOPTIONAL PARAMS[0m
  [1mname[0m
    A name for the model 
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Automatically assign instrument data using the cron 
    Default value 'true' if not specified
  [1mnoauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Make auto-assign-inst-data 'false' 
  [1mtumor-sample[0m
    If there are no variants, specify the "tumor" sample directly 
  [1mnormal-sample[0m
    If there are no variants, specify the "normal" sample directly 
  [1msample-list-file[0m
    A file of samples for which to make models.  Each line should have the samples that should be
    paired together with the control to the left.  If more than two are on each line, each sample
    on the line will be paired with every sample to its right in turn. (Provide this in lieu of
    variants or the --tumor-sample and --normal-sample.) 
  [1mregion-of-interest-set[0m
    Specify this if reference coverage should be run on a different set than the target 
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    Processing profile for the model 
  [1mgroups[0m
    Group(s) to which to add the newly created model(s) 
  [1mDESIGN[0m
    BED file (or database id) of the designs for the probes 
  [1mTARGET[0m
    BED file (or database id) of the target region set 
  [1mVARIANTS[0m
    One or more BED files (or database ids) of the variants to validate
