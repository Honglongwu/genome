[4mREQUIRED INPUTS[0m
  [1mcondition-labels-string[0m
    A comma-delimmited list of labels used to represent each group or condition. ex: "A,B,C,D" 
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    Processing profile to be used by model, can provide either a name or an id 
  [1mcondition-model-ids-string[0m
    Each group is a comma-delimited list of model ids corresponding to a defined label(order
    matters).  Each group (A, B, C & D) is separated by white space. ex: "1,2 3,4 5,6 7,8" 

[4mOPTIONAL INPUTS[0m
  [1minstrument-data[0m
    Instrument data to be assigned to the model, can provide a query to resolve, a list of ids, etc 
  [1msubject[0m
    Subject for the model, can provide either a name or an id. If instrument data is provided and
    this is not, an attempt will be made to resolve it based on the provided instrument data 
  [1mgroups[0m
    Model groups to put the newly created model into 
  [1mmodel-name[0m
    User meaningful name for this model, a default is used if none is provided 
  [1mprojects[0m
    Projects for the model. 
  [1mreference-sequence-build[0m
    (undocumented) 
  [1mannotation-build[0m
    (undocumented) 

[4mOPTIONAL PARAMS[0m
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Assigning instrument data to the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'false' (--noauto-assign-inst-data) if not specified
  [1mauto-build-alignments[0m
    The building of the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'true' if not specified

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    This defines a new genome model for the specified subject, using the specified processing
    profile.

    The first build of a model must be explicitly requested after the model is defined.
