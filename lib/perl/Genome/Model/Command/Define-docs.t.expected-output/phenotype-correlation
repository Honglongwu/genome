  --model-name test5
  --subject ley_aml_patient1_tumor
  --processing-profile nature_aml_08

[4mREQUIRED INPUTS[0m
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    Processing profile to be used by model, can provide either a name or an id 

[4mREQUIRED PARAMS[0m
  [1mreference-sequence-build[0m
    the reference sequence against which alignment and variant detection are done 

[4mOPTIONAL INPUTS[0m
  [1minstrument-data[0m
    Instrument data to be assigned to the model, can provide a query to resolve, a list of ids, etc 
  [1msubject[0m
    Subject for the model, can provide either a name or an id. If instrument data is provided and
    this is not, an attempt will be made to resolve it based on the provided instrument data 
  [1mgroups[0m
    Model groups to put the newly created model into 
  [1mmodel-name[0m
    User meaningful name for this model, a default is used if none is provided 
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Assigning instrument data to the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'false' (--noauto-assign-inst-data) if not specified
  [1mnoauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Make auto-assign-inst-data 'false' 
  [1mprojects[0m
    Projects for the model. 
  [1mauto-build-alignments[0m
    The building of the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'true' if not specified
  [1mnoauto-build-alignments[0m
    Make auto-build-alignments 'false' 

[4mOPTIONAL PARAMS[0m
  [1mdbsnp-build[0m
    the dbSNP build by which to determine which variants are novel etc 
  [1mthousand-genomes-build[0m
    the 1kg build by which to annotate allele frequencies 
  [1mglm-config-file[0m
    the model file for the glm 
  [1mnhlbi-esp-build[0m
    the nhlbi esp build by which to annotate allele frequencies 
  [1mprevious-variant-detection-results[0m
    path to a VCF of previous: skip variant detection and use this 
  [1mnomenclature[0m
    nomenclature used to access clinical data 
  [1mroi-list[0m
    only variants in these regions will be included in the final VCF 
  [1mpedigree-file-path[0m
    when supplied overrides the automatic lookup of familial relationships 
  [1mclinical-data-file-path[0m
    when supplied overrides the dumping of clinical data from the nomenclature 
  [1midentify-cases-by[0m
    the expression which matches "case" samples, typically by their attributes 
  [1midentify-controls-by[0m
    the expression which matches "control" samples, typically by their attributes
