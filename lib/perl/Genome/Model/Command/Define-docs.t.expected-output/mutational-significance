[4mSYNOPSIS[0m
First, determine what group of ClinSeq models you want to work on.  This might be all models in a model group, for example.
Next, create a population group to use as subject:
genome population-group create --models model_groups.id=29624
Finally, define your model using the query for ClinSeq models and the id of the population group you just created.
genome model define mutational-significance --model-name "Example Mutational Significance" --processing-profile "Oct 2012 Default" --annotation-build 106409619 --clinseq-models model_groups.id=29624 --subject id=2882703149

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    The mutational significance genome model represents analysis on a collection of clinseq models.
    There is an option to run the MuSiC pipeline to run various statistical tests on the collection
    of variants. Additionally, a list of variants can be compiled that should be suitable for use
    as a validation list.
