[4mREQUIRED INPUTS[0m
  [1mtumor-model[0m
    Name or id of tumor model being analyzed 
  [1mnormal-model[0m
    Name or id of normal model being analyzed 
  [1mannotation-build[0m
    Id of annotation build to use for fast tiering of variants 
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    the collection of parameters to be used during the build process 

[4mREQUIRED PARAMS[0m
  [1mprocessing-profile-name[0m
    (undocumented) 

[4mOPTIONAL INPUTS[0m
  [1madd-to-projects[0m
    add the new model to these projects (model groups) 
  [1mforce[0m
    Allow creation of somatic variation models where --tumor_model and --normal_model do not have
    matching Genome::Individuals 
    Default value 'false' (--noforce) if not specified
  [1minstrument-data[0m
    Instrument data to be assigned to the model, can provide a query to resolve, a list of ids, etc 
  [1msubject[0m
    Subject for the model, can provide either a name or an id. If instrument data is provided and
    this is not, an attempt will be made to resolve it based on the provided instrument data 
  [1mgroups[0m
    Model groups to put the newly created model into 
  [1mmodel-name[0m
    User meaningful name for this model, a default is used if none is provided 
  [1mpreviously-discovered-variations-build[0m
    Id of imported variants build to screen somatic variants against 
  [1msubject-name[0m
    Subject name is derived from normal and tumor models and is not necessary as input to somatic
    models 

[4mOPTIONAL PARAMS[0m
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Assigning instrument data to the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'false' (--noauto-assign-inst-data) if not specified
  [1mauto-build-alignments[0m
    The building of the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'true' if not specified

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    This defines a new genome model representing the somatic analysis between a normal and tumor
    model.
